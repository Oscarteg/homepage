title: Uses
---

I am a big user of a lot of things so I thought it would be nice to create a page to display the things I use. 

## Terminal

I use iTerm2 as my terminal and currently with the [Night Owl](https://github.com/nickcernis/iterm2-night-owl) theme. I use Night Owl almost everywhere. I use [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) with the agnoster theme. I switch theme every couple of months with some custom themes like [Spaceship-Prompt](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt) and [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure). I use [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) to manage my plugins and themes. It's so easy to use!

I don't use vim often but for small changes I think it works nice, so I use [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) to manage my vim plugins. These are my vim plugins:

```
- scrooloose/nerdtree.git
- scrooloose/syntastic
- vim-airline/vim-airline
- vim-airline/vim-airline-themes
- airblade/vim-gitgutter
- vim-ctrlspace/vim-ctrlspace
- tpope/vim-fugitive.git
- tpope/vim-surround
- mileszs/ack.vim
- Shougo/neocomplcache.vim
- ayu-theme/ayu-vim
- dracula/vim
- posva/vim-vue
- haishanh/night-owl.vim
```

### Command line 
I use the command line every day. With [homebrew](https://brew.sh) (ofcourse) I install everything I need, like;

```
- htop
- httpie
- ctop
- pandoc
- neovim
- php 
- unrar
- youtube-dl
- doctl
```

## Editor(s)
**Code editor for big things:** At the moment I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for most front end development and small websites or scripts.
