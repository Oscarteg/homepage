title: Uses
description: Everything I use on a daily bases
---

I am a big user of new software and so I thought it would be nice to create a page to display the things I use.

## Terminal

I use iTerm2 as my terminal and currently with the [Night Owl](https://github.com/nickcernis/iterm2-night-owl) theme. I use Night Owl almost everywhere. I use [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) with the agnoster theme. I switch theme every couple of months with some custom themes like [Spaceship-Prompt](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt) and [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure). I use [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) to manage my plugins and themes. It's so easy to use!

I don't use vim often but for small changes I think it works nice, I used to use Vundle but I started realizing I don't use anything from it. So I switched to just a simple `.vimrc` that you can see in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/oscarteg/dotfiles).

### Command line

I use the command line every day. With [homebrew](https://brew.sh) (ofcourse) I install everything I need, like;

- htop
- httpie
- ctop
- pandoc
- neovim
- php
- unrar
- youtube-dl
- doctl
- the_silver_searcher
- nvm
- m-cli
- hub
- git
- composer

## Editor(s)

**Code editor for small things:** At the moment I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for most front end development and small websites or scripts. Here I also use the Night Owl theme but also switch regularly with the [Rainglow](https://rainglow.io/) themes or with [Ayu](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu). Other essential plugins I use are advanced-new-file, Docker, GitLens, Project Manager and some Intellisense plugins.

**Code editor for big things:** For big projects I use mostly [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for all other languages (PHP, Laravel, HTML/CSS/Javascript etc.). I love that with a couple of plugins the IDE handles everything I need and I don't need to switch every time. Some essential plugins are Material Theme UI with (ofcoure) the Nigh Owl theme. I recently started programming in GoLang and for that I use [GoLang](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/).

## Design

I don't design much but I need to look at some design files every once in a while. My preference is [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/). I tried [Figma](https://www.figma.com) but I couldn't get over that it's a webview. I would happen to much that I would want to scroll to the left and the browser goes back a page. Also I use [Nucleo](https://nucleoapp.com/) for most icons I need.

### Fonts

Everywhere I can I use the [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/) font. I love the ligatures. I use it as mono font in my browser, terminal and IDE's.

## Database

I recently made the switch from Sequel Pro to [Table Plus](https://tableplus.io/). It is a paid software but the quality is so much better. It supports a lot of other data stores like Postgresql and even Redis. I love that you have to commit changes that you make so you can create a single transaction.

## Window management

I use [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) with some shortcuts to move the window to the left and right. I don't need more than that.

## Webdevelopment

I have a couple of apps I use every thing for developing:

- [Paw](https://paw.cloud)
- [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/)
- [Code kit](https://codekitapp.com/) - _I don't really use this every day. Only when I have a single HTML page I want to serve with hot reload. Not really neccessary though._
- [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)

## Writing

For editing markdown files I use [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). It's a simple markdown editor but not really what I'm looking for. I have multiple JamStack projects and iA Writer indexes all the files in `node_modules` so it's rather slow. It is more focussed on writing when you use iCloud as your storage. I am looking for something else but not sure what. Sometimes I use [Typora](https://typora.io/) but it feels still a bit beta.

## Productivity & Tools

- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) - I use this with the [GTD](https://hamberg.no/gtd/) workflow

- [1Password](https://1password.com/)
- [Pixsave](http://www.littlehj.com/)
- [Trello](https://trello.com)
- [Sip](https://sipapp.io/)
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - I use this a lot with workflows like Spotify Mini Player, HTTP, Dash, Philips Hue Controller.
- [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/)
- [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) - I use BetterTouchTool with the [GoldenChaos](https://goldenchaos.net/goldenchaos-btt.html) settings for my touchbar.

## Books

I have been collecting books for a couple of years. I manage all my digital books with [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/). I am, as they say a _/r/DataHoarder_. I love collecting data and files and things. I love collecting books even though I don't read all of them.

## Resources

I always start my day with some reading. I have some websites I visit and I subscribed to some newsletters.

### Websites

- [Hackernews](https://vue-hn.herokuapp.com/top) I use the vue version of hackernews because it has websockets so I don't have to refresh all the time.
- [Gitnews](https://git.news) For the newest most exciting stuff on Github.
- [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/europe) I'm new to reading this as I want to learn more about the stock market.

- [Blendle](https://blendle.com) I don't like reading the paper but I want to know what is going on in the world. Blendle is a dutch service that gives me articles specific for my need and even reads some articles about big news worthy events.
- [De Correspondent](https://decorrespondent.nl/) Another news service but this one is completely independent with articles that have a different perspective on things.

### Newsletters

- [TLDR](https://www.tldrnewsletter.com/)
- [Morning Cup of Coding](https://www.humanreadablemag.com/morningcupofcoding)
