For an assignment at school, we had to research how the compiler works of a programming language. We could pick any programming language we want. I picked Ruby but all the concepts of Ruby were familiar and I wanted a challenge. The concepts of OO programming already made sense to me because I already knew Java and PHP. I wanted something new. I looked into Rust but it seemed to difficult to learn in a short period. Then I remembered _Go(lang)_. I was intrigued. I found and followed [GoByExample](https://gobyexample.com) and step by step I learned new things. This is a post of the most interesting things I have learned coming from a OO and loosely typed

## Structs

When you ask if Go is an object-oriented programming language you hear **yes** and **no** at the same time. From the FAQ it says:

> Yes and no. Although Go has types and methods and allows an object-oriented style of programming, there is no type of hierarchy. The concept of “interface” in Go provides a different approach that we believe is easy to use and in some ways more general. There are also ways to embed types in other types to provide something analogous—but not identical—to subclassing. Moreover, methods in Go are more general than in C++ or Java: they can be defined for any sort of data, even built-in types such as plain, “unboxed” integers. They are not restricted to structs (classes).

Go does not provide classes but it does provide **structs**. Methods can be added on structs. This provides the behaviour of bundling the data and methods that operate on the data together akin to a class.

```go
// This `person` struct type has `name` and `age` fields.
type person struct {
  name string
  age  int
}

func main() {
  // This syntax creates a new struct.
  fmt.Println(person{"Bob", 20})

  // You can name the fields when initializing a struct.
  fmt.Println(person{name: "Alice", age: 30})

  // Omitted fields will be zero-valued.
  fmt.Println(person{name: "Fred"})

  // An `&` prefix yields a pointer to the struct.
  fmt.Println(&person{name: "Ann", age: 40})

  // Access struct fields with a dot.
  s := person{name: "Sean", age: 50}
  fmt.Println(s.name)

  // You can also use dots with struct pointers - the
  // pointers are automatically dereferenced.
  sp := &s
  fmt.Println(sp.age)

  // Structs are mutable.
  sp.age: 51
  fmt.Println(sp.age)
}
```

## Pointers

In most programming languages you have the option to use a pointer. I have mostly developed in PHP and have only once needed to use a pointer in PHP. In Go, it is much more common to use a pointer. This was a first for me. A pointer is used to allow you to pass references to values and records within your program. Simply put, a pointer is a value which points to the address of another. When a function is called with an argument, that argument is copied to the function. See the following example;

```go
func zero(x int) {
  x: 0
}
func main() {
  x := 5
  zero(x)
  fmt.Println(x) // x is still 5
}
```

In this program, the zero function will not modify the original x variable in the main function. But what if we wanted to? One way to do this is to use a special data type, a pointer;

```go
func zero(xPtr *int) {
  *xPtr: 0
}
func main() {
  x := 5
  zero(&x)
  fmt.Println(x) // x is 0
}
```

Pointers reference a location in memory where a value is stored rather than the value itself. By using a pointer (\*int) the zero function can modify the original variable instead of the copy.

## Go routines

In simple terms, a goroutine is a _lightweight thread of execution_. This means that the code is executed on a different thread and this routine runs in the background while the rest of the code is executed.

```go
import "fmt"

package main

func doSomething(str sting) {
     for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
          fmt.Printf("%s: %d", str, i)
     }
}

func main() {
    // calling this function the normal way
    doSomething("Hello")

    // Running it inside a go routine
    go doSomething("World")

    // Anonymous go routine
    go func() {
        fmt.Print("Go routines are awesome")
    }()
}
```

## Channels

Golang its biggest features is concurrency. In the previous paragraph, I have explained what Go routines are and how to use them. Concurrency is a first-class citizen of Golang and one of the fundamental features is Go routines as described in the previous paragraph.

The creators of Golang noticed that sometimes Go routines need to communicate with each other and they created _channels_. Channels are a

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // make a new channel
    messages := make(chan string)
    go func() {
        // write to channel
        message <- "Hello World!"
    }()

    // read from channel
    message :=  <-messages

   fmt.Printf("I got the message %s", message)
}
```

## Multiple returns

## Worker pools

## Named return values

## Underscore (blank identifier)

> Identifiers are the user-defined name of the program components used for the identification purpose. The blank identifier is to define and unused variables.

The compiler of Golang does not allow for unused variables and for that you _have_ to use the blank identifier to ignore left-hand side values in an assignment.

```go
func main() {

    array := []int{1, 2}

    // Range returns both the current index and value
    // but sometimes you may only want to use the value
    for _, element := range array {
        fmt.Println(element)
    }

}
```

## Generics

As someone that had Java in college and later worked with non statically typed languages like PHP, I had to read up on what generics where. So here goes;

> Generics gives a type or method the possibility to operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety.

This means that a method or type is made "generic" and can handle all kinds of types without knowing what it is exactly upfront.
