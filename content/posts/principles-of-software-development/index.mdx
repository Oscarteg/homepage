In software development you hear a lot of new technologies and terms. Some of those terms have been fundamentals for a long time and this is just a small reference list to look at when people name some acronym to look smart.

## Principles of software development

### DRY

**Don't repeat yourself** is one of the most used and misused terms. When you take it literally it suggests that you should never repeat yourself, which is a common misconception. When you think of DRY you should think if what you are writing is already implemented somewhere else and if that is used in the same context. It totally depends on the situation if you should use DRY.
