The term **REST** is quite known for developers that are starting web development in the last 10 year. But, for the people that don't know REST stands for _Representational State Transfer_. REST is an architectural pattern for creating web services. A system that is **RESTful** implements this architectural pattern.

## When is something RESTful?

To consider something RESTful it has to be following these six constraints:

### Client-server architecture

### Statelessness

### Cacheability

### Layered system

### Code on demand

### Uniform interface
