I like to try new things, but when you want to be productive and develop something usefull it isn't always the best idea. So when I wanted to build my new TODO_PLACEHOLDER app I had a lot of new things to learn. This was not a good way to stay productive but I still learned a lot about Graphql, Prisma and Apollo. Also I programmed it in Go which is the first time I have done something in Go.

First the tech stack. TODO_PLACEHOLDER is build with React, Typescript, Apollo, Ant Design, TailwindCSS on the frontend and Go, Prisma, MongoDB
