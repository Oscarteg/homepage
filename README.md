# Homepage

This is the repository to my personal website that can be found on [https://oscartegiffel.com](https://oscartegiffel.com).

It uses the frameworks VueJS and Bulma.

This is licensed under MIT and under heavy development. Everything is broken every once in a while.

## Developer

`yarn install` or `npm install` to install the dependencies
`yarn run dev` or `npm run dev` to start the development server
