title: 'Uses'
---

I am a big user of new software and so I thought it would be nice to create a page to display the things I use.

## Terminal

I use iTerm2 as my terminal and currently with the [Night Owl](https://github.com/nickcernis/iterm2-night-owl) theme. I use Night Owl almost everywhere. I use [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) with the agnoster theme. I switch theme every couple of months with some custom themes like [Spaceship-Prompt](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt) and [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure). I use [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) to manage my plugins and themes. It's so easy to use!

I don't use vim often but for small changes I think it works nice, I used to use Vundle but I started realizing I don't use anything from it. So I switched to just a simple `.vimrc` that you can see in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/oscarteg/dotfiles).

### Command line

I use the command line every day. With [homebrew](https://brew.sh) (ofcourse) I install everything I need, like;

- lazydocker
- lazygit
- htop
- httpie
- neovim
- the_silver_searcher
- nvm
- m-cli
- hub
- annie
- git
- composer

## Editor(s)

### Code editor for small things

At the moment I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for most front end development and small websites or scripts. Here I also use the Night Owl theme but also switch regularly with the [Rainglow](https://rainglow.io/) themes or with [Ayu](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu). Other essential plugins I use are advanced-new-file, Docker, GitLens, Project Manager and some Intellisense plugins.

### Code editor for big things

For big projects I use mostly [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for all other languages (PHP, Laravel, HTML/CSS/Javascript etc.). I love that with a couple of plugins the IDE handles everything I need and I don't need to switch every time. Some essential plugins are Material Theme UI with (ofcoure) the Nigh Owl theme. I recently started programming in GoLang and for that I use [GoLang](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/).

## Design

I don't design much but I need to look at some design files every once in a while. My preference is [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/). I tried [Figma](https://www.figma.com) but I couldn't get over that it's a webview. I would happen to much that I would want to scroll to the left and the browser goes back a page. Also I use [Nucleo](https://nucleoapp.com/) for most icons I need.

### Fonts

- Dank Mono
- MonoLisa
- Apercu
- Operator Mono
- IBM Plex Mono
- MonoLisa

This is a list of fonts I use. I have set different types of fonts for different filetypes.

## Database

I recently made the switch from Sequel Pro to [Table Plus](https://tableplus.io/). It is a paid software but the quality is so much better. It supports a lot of other data stores like Postgresql and even Redis.

## Window management

I use [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) with some shortcuts to move the window to the left and right. I don't need more than that.

## Webdevelopment

I have a couple of apps I use every thing for developing:

- [Paw](https://paw.cloud)
- [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/)
- [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)
- Intellij Idea
- Visual Studio Code

## Writing

For editing markdown files I use [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). It's a simple markdown editor but not really what I'm looking for. I have multiple JamStack projects and iA Writer indexes all the files in `node_modules` so it's rather slow. It is more focussed on writing when you use iCloud as your storage.

## Productivity

For years I have been trying to perfect my productivity _flow_.

- Notion - My everyday typing note taking app.
- Workflowy - To make a list of things I have to do in a day for work. So I can also revise what I have done.
- Instapaper - Saving articles for later
- Bear - Don't use this very often. ButÂ for when I want to focus on a single markdown page for writing.
- Day One - My goto journaling app
- iPad Pro
  - Notability - For taking handwritten notes.
  - Goodnotes - I have it but have not found a good way to use it.
- Things - My app for [_Getting Things Done_](https://hamberg.no/gtd)
- Habitify - For creating a daily routine and making habits of the goals I want to achieve.
- Focus - Sometimes I have issues with focusing. This blocks all the applications and websites that distract me.
- Forest (iOS) - My pomodoro timer for planting forests.
- Anki - Learning new langauages.

### Tools

- [Timing](https://timingapp.com/)
- [SnippetsLab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/)
- [1Password](https://1password.com/)
- [Pixsave](http://www.littlehj.com/)
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - I use this a lot with workflows like Spotify Mini Player, HTTP, Dash, Philips Hue Controller.
- [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/)
- [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) - I use BetterTouchTool with the [GoldenChaos](https://goldenchaos.net/goldenchaos-btt.html) settings for my touchbar.

I have been trying to find my own way into consildating knowledge. I have tried things like, Zettelkasten and Obsidian but it just wasn't for me. I recently bought an iPad Pro with the stylus and it works great. Writing my own notes without the worry of the notes becoming a mess is a great feelin. These are my iPad pro essentials:

- Notability
- Things
- Goodnotes

## Books

I have been collecting books for a couple of years. I manage all my digital books with [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/). I am, as they say a _/r/DataHoarder_. I love collecting data and files and things. I love collecting books even though I don't read all of them. You can look at [books](/books) for some books I am reading or have read.
